I am an Electronics and Instrumentation student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, currently in my 3rd year.I have a general interest in robotics and automation and love to fiddle around with these. I tried multiple things to find my interests in general. I started with developing websites for various events across campus. After finding that redudant, my interest started to shift towards aerial robotics.
