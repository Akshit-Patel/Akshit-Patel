I am a junior engineering student at BITS Pilani who likes to explore and innovate. I have experience in developing robotic simulations involving tools like ROS, Gazebo, and MATLAB. Apart from this, I have also been part of different web development projects oriented towards college fests. 
When I am free I like binging, working out and playing computer games, currently active on krunker.
