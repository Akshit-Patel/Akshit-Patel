I am an Electronics and Instrumentation student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, currently in my 3rd year.I have a general interest in robotics and automation and love to fiddle around with things. I tried multiple things to find my interests in general. I started with developing websites for various events across campus and then gradually got interested in industrial automation. I would still love to work and explore on different development projects.
