  I worked on designing closed-loop control of motors used in the E-tricycle project for the disabled and elderly. We successfully obtained parameters of BLDC motors with unknown parameters and designed a closed-loop control by using various PID techniques by simulating that motor in MATLAB-SIMULINK with the parameters obtained. Some of the advanced PID techniques used were self tuning adaptive Fuzzy PID constants and Genetic Algorithm PID tuning.
