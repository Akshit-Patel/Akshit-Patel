ABSTRACT="Brushless DC (BLDC) motors have become the
optimal choice for high-precision controller implementation in
industrial applications. This paper presents a detailed analysis
of a hub BLDC motor used in low power electric vehicles right from
parameter estimation to
the implementation of speed control techniques. The parameter
estimation is followed by the development of the mathematical
model of the BLDC motor. The conventional PID technique
and the genetic algorithm-based tuning are applied to the
mathematical model. Further physical model of the motor
is constructed and simulated for broadly 3 control methods:
Conventional PID, Genetic algorithm, and self-tuning Fuzzy logic
method. The purpose of the research is to provide a comparative
analysis of these control strategies and to identify the optimal
one for speed-control of the BLDC hub motor. Results show that
the proposed, adaptive Fuzzy logic technique is the best control
design for practical implementation."
